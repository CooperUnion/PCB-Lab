# Holiday Tree

This folder contains all the files related to the PCB Lab Workshop where students create a "Holiday Tree" PCB. This serves as a demonstration for the PCB process and familiarize students with using Alitum Designer, where students were sign up for a free Altium Designer student account.

## Slide Deck
The "PCB Lab Workshop 1.pptx" is a slide deck ([linked here as well]([e=form_post&response_type=code%20id_token&resource=00000003-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000&scope=openid&nonce=B8AE41F11A524162CD4821DBFA1DAB3AA10E448537BC6F52-EE1E7B4098702D2946BCBCD757EDD3CA6BF13B2DB58822073E2D993167AA36BF&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcooperunion-my%2Esharepoint%2Ecom%2F_forms%2Fdefault%2Easpx&state=OD0w&login_hint=ridwan%2Ehussain%40cooper%2Eedu&claims=%7B"id_token"%3A%7B"xms_cc"%3A%7B"values"%3A%5B"CP1"%5D%7D%7D%7D&wsucxt=1&cobrandid=11bd8083-87e0-41b5-bb78-0bc43c8a8e8a&client-request-id=016f8da1-a091-8000-6758-6954b2935649](https://cooperunion-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/azra_rangwala_cooper_edu/EbGn8QKjnDpMtfv-3FgYGA8BFtRYjlDQLNusCYTNk-tKLQ?e=ztoXCt&CID=3c50dd26-915c-48b5-a09c-e2f5cdac73e5)))that students used and referenced during the workshop in order to make the PCB. This slide deck can be used as a standalone reference and helps students to remember how to do a specific part of the PCB process from schematic design, to layout, to gerber out.

## Altium Files
This contains the Altium files used as a reference in the slide deck as well as images if anyone would like to view the PCB in altium.
