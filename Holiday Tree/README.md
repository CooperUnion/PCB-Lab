# Holiday Tree

This folder contains all the files related to the PCB Lab Workshop where students create a "Holiday Tree" PCB. This serves as a demonstration for the PCB process and familiarize students with using Alitum Designer, where students were sign up for a free Altium Designer student account.

## Slide Deck
The "PCB Lab Workshop 1.pptx" is a slide deck that students used and referenced during the workshop in order to make the PCB. This slide deck can be used as a standalone reference and helps students to remember how to do a specific part of the PCB process from schematic design, to layout, to gerber out.

## Altium Files
This contains the Altium files used as a reference in the slide deck as well as images if anyone would like to view the PCB in altium.
